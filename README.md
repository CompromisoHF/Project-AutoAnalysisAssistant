# Project-AutoAnalysisAssistant
This project was created to build a standard data analysis procedure for Lab using AFM. 
•	Designed a lab specific software ‘One-Click raw data analyzer’ using MATLAB and Add-on App for MATLAB
•	Using Machine Learning knowledge (HOG + SVM) to realize auto-selecting valid data by training model based on lab’s previous database
•	Designed a new mathematical based algorithm to find specific pattern called ‘step force’ in raw data
